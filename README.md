## Application Description:

Spy issue Tracker is a modern project organization and issue tracking service. Spy was born initially from my desire to create a practical and widely useable application. Both organizations and individuals need new and easier ways of organizing the details of their endeavors. Personally I have used applications like Monday or Trello for project organization and loved the ease of use and clean ui. But when I have a personal project I rarely use much more than a journal or note taking application on my phone, there are times when completing projects of smaller scale these applications can become a bit unwieldy, too big for the task at hand. What if I could create a hybrid application that combined the ease of standard mobile note taking apps and the organizational power and clean ui of a modern project tracking app? With
Spy Issue Tracker you can create and track projects easily with clean mobile focused UI.

## Application Features:
